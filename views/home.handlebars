          OpenSecrets.org is a website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in U.S. politics, and the effect it has on public policy and elections. OpenSecrets.org is a comprehensive resource that allows the public access to data concerning federal campaign contributions, from finances concerning specific legislators to the organizations that support them. This information can be accessed directly through the OpenSecrets API (stands for Application Program Interface), a library of methods that return data specific to the requests being made. We can display this data on a web page, keeping up-to-date data on various candidates, and much more. To begin, we will navigate how to access this data and use the OpenSecrets API to discover all kinds of information about our U.S. politicians.
